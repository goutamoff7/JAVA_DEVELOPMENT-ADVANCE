Step-by-Step Process: Fetching Student Data using Postman
1. Start Your Spring Boot Application
Ensure your Spring Boot application is running on localhost:8080.
The SecurityConfiguration and all related layers (model, repository, controller, and service) should be properly configured as shown in your code.
2. Set Up Authentication in Postman
Open Postman and create a new GET request.
URL: http://localhost:8080/students
3. Enable Basic Authentication in Postman
In Postman, go to the Authorization tab.
Choose Basic Auth from the dropdown.
Enter the valid username and password that you have stored in your Users table.
For example:

Username: user
Password: user@123
This will include the Authorization header in your request automatically.

4. Send GET Request to Fetch Students Data
After setting up the authentication, click Send.
5. Spring Security Workflow
Now, let's break down what happens behind the scenes when you send the request:

Request Hits HttpSecurity Filter Chain:
When you send a request to http://localhost:8080/students, Spring Security first intercepts it through the SecurityFilterChain defined in your SecurityConfiguration class.

java
Copy code
httpSecurity
    .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
        .anyRequest().authenticated())
    .sessionManagement(session -> session
        .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))
    .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults());

The httpBasic() method ensures that Basic Authentication is used.
anyRequest().authenticated() means that every request requires authentication.
Username and Password Validation:
The username and password you entered in Postman are extracted from the Authorization header. Spring Security uses the DaoAuthenticationProvider to authenticate these credentials.

java
Copy code
provider.setPasswordEncoder(NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance());
provider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService);

The userDetailsService is responsible for loading the user based on the username through the UserRepository.
Spring fetches the Users entity using the findByUsername method in UserRepository.

java
Copy code
Optional<Users> findByUsername(String username);

The password is then compared to the stored password in the Users entity using the NoOpPasswordEncoder (or any other encoder if you've changed it).
UserDetailsService Implementation:
Your custom MyUserDetailsService loads the user by calling UserRepository.findByUsername(username). If the user is found, it returns a UserPrincipal, which implements UserDetails.

java
Copy code
Users user = userRepository.findByUsername(username)
    .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found"));

If the user exists and the password matches, the user is successfully authenticated.

Grant Access to the /students Resource:
If authentication is successful, the request proceeds to the StudentController where the /students endpoint is defined.

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/students")
public List<Student> getStudents() {
    return students;
}

The controller returns a list of Student objects.

6. Postman Response
Once the authentication is successful and the request passes through the security layers, you’ll get a 200 OK response along with the list of students in JSON format:

json
Copy code
[
    {
        "id": 24,
        "name": "Goutam",
        "marks": 56
    },
    {
        "id": 25,
        "name": "Arpan",
        "marks": 65
    }
]

7. Error Handling (If Authentication Fails)
If the username or password is incorrect, you will receive a 401 Unauthorized response with an error message:

json
Copy code
{
    "timestamp": "2023-07-27T10:12:34.567+00:00",
    "status": 401,
    "error": "Unauthorized",
    "message": "Unauthorized",
    "path": "/students"
}

This happens because Spring Security denies access when the authentication fails.

Summary of Workflow:
Request to /students → Intercepted by Spring Security.
Basic Authentication → Username and password are extracted.
UserDetailsService → Loads user from the database using UserRepository.findByUsername().
AuthenticationProvider → Validates the password.
Authentication Success → If successful, proceeds to StudentController.
Student Data → Returns the list of students in JSON format to Postman.
This completes the process of fetching student data with proper authentication using Spring Security.
